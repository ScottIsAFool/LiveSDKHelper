# What is it? #
This is a helper library to enable a developer to more easily use the Microsoft Live SDK which can be trying at the best of times. With this library, things are made a lot easier.

#Code samples#
More samples will be done in time, in the mean time, there is a Windows Phone 8 sample client that gives the basics on what can be done.

# Latest version #
Latest version is 0.1.0.7 which can be pulled down from nuget by doing the following command:

`Install-Package LiveSDKHelper`

# Release History #
0.1.0.7: Added static methods for calendar events to automatically deserialise the result. Added a MyFiles property to the MyDetails class.

0.1.0.6: Changed item size to be long rather than int as file sizes are in bytes and can get large.
